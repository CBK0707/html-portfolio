<h2>Top 3 Movies </h2>

<h3> Harry Potter Movies</h3>
<p> I like HP movies because, when the first movies were released, I was 10 years old. It was easy to relate yourself to such adventures, especially if the main characters are the same age as you. </p>
<h3> The Lord of The Rings</h3>
<p> I don't think that i have to explain why i freakin love it</p>
<h3> Fast and Furious</h3>
<p> Guys like cars and girls.</p>
